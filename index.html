       <blockquote>
        Would just as<mark>Deedee</mark>is an idiom that means you would much rather something (or anything) else than what was suggested, such as "I would just as soon starve than eat there again." This phrase is sometimes incorrectly stated or written as "would just assume," which is an eggcorn, or a soundalike phrase that is used mistakenly.
